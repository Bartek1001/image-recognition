This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube tutorial showing how to create image recognition in Python using Logistic Regression.
All dataset is taken from Kaggle. Accuracy of model: 92%.
I have also added a file containing the data from CSV: image_recognition.rar 
It might helps with downloading CSV files because these files are large.

Python libraries used in project:
- pandas,
- matplotlib,
- sklearn,
- random,
- seaborn,

Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:
- read data from CSV using pandas,
- reshape data,
- model training,
- model validation,
